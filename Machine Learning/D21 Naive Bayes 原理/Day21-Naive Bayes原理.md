### 思考題：為什麼特徵獨立的假設足以讓 Naive Bayes 被稱為 Naive?
*All naive Bayes classifiers assume that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable.* For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 10 cm in diameter. A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to contribute independently to the probability that this fruit is an apple, **regardless of any possible correlations between the color, roundness, and diameter features.**
