## 監督式學習 (Supervised learning)
- 優點 (Advantages):
    - It exists notions of the output along the learning process.
    - It performs classification and regression tasks.
    - It allows estimating or mapping the results to a new sample.
- 缺點 (Disadvantages):
    - It requires a labelled dataset.
    - It requires a training process.
## 非監督式學習 (Unsupervised learning)
- 優點 (Advantages):
    - It does not require a training data to be labelled.
    - The automatic labelling of the training dataset saving the time spent in hand classification.
    - Classification task is fast.
- 缺點 (Disadvantages):
    - There are no notions of the output along the learning process.
    - It does not allow to estimate or map the results of a new sample.
    - Results vary considerably in the presence of outliers.
    - It only performs classification task.
